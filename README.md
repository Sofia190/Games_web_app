# Games_web_app


This web application can be developed further to host games.

It has functionality for signing up users, creating usermember profiles, it has a forum, sending messages and evaluating games.

The app is not very well structured, but it provides a clear understanding of how the components are related to each other.

If you would like to contribute to this project and have any ideas that would like to share, please make a pull request on github.
